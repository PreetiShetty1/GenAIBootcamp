          <title>Background</title>
          <p id="Par1">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and Twist1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cell dissemination are well established, but the involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in Twist1-mediated signaling remains largely unknown.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p id="Par2">RT-qPCR and western blotting were conducted to detect the expression levels of lncRNA JPX and Twist1 in lung cancer cell lines and tissues. The impact of JPX on Twist1 expression, cell growth, invasion, apoptosis, and in vivo tumor growth were investigated in lung cancer cells by western blotting, rescue experiments, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, and xenograft animal experiment.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p id="Par3">We observed that lncRNA JPX was upregulated in lung cancer metastatic tissues and was closely correlated with tumor size and an advanced stage. Functionally, JPX promoted lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and facilitated lung tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, JPX upregulated Twist1 by competitively sponging miR-33a-5p and subsequently induced EMT and lung cancer cell invasion. Interestingly, JPX and Twist1 were coordinately upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cells. Mechanically, the JPX/miR-33a-5p/Twist1 axis participated in EMT progression by activating Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin signaling.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p id="Par4">These findings suggest that lncRNA JPX, a mediator of Twist1 signaling, could predispose lung cancer cells to metastasis and may serve as a potential target for targeted therapy.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p id="Par20">Lung cancer is one of the most malignant of all cancer, and the 5-year survival rates vary from 4 to 17% depending on stage and regional differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although many advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer in recent years, metastasis still remains the main challenge posed by advanced lung cancer leading to high mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, the elucidation of a new oncogenic pathway is required to precisely target lung cancer and to serve as a prognostic factor. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides in length with considerable potential to drive cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par21">Aberrantly expressed lncRNAs have been found to be associated with the occurrence and development of various types of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, lncRNAs affect gene expression through various mechanisms in which lncRNAs regulate their target genes by acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, thereby affecting the growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network, lncRNAs act as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) of specific mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Specifically, lncRNA SMAD5-AS1 could upregulate adenomatous polyposis coli expression by sponging miR-135b-5p and inactivate the canonical Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin pathway to inhibit diffuse large B cell lymphoma proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, lncRNA PVT1 was found to regulate hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression by competitively binding to endogenous miR-143 in gallbladder cancer (GBC) cells, suggesting an important role of the PVT1/miR-143/HK2 axis in cell proliferation and metastasis by modulating aerobic glucose metabolism in GBC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, the function and mechanism of most aberrantly expressed lncRNAs as ceRNAs in lung cancer remain unclear.</p>
      <p id="Par22">Our previous work showed that miR-33a-5p negatively regulated Twist1, thus inhibiting the invasion and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and served as a potential biomarker for early lung cancer diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Twist1 is an important transcription factor that mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression and tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin signaling is a critical driver in EMT and cancer metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It has been found that miRNAs can participate in the EMT process by regulating the Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin pathway in a variety of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, we considered whether an lncRNA could form a ceRNA network with miR-33a-5p and Twist1 to participate in EMT and malignant processes in lung cancer. In the present study, we identified that JPX, an upregulated lncRNA in lung cancer, acted as a ceRNA for Twist1 through binding with miR-33a-5p. As an oncogene, JPX affected the tumor size, TNM staging, and metastasis of lung cancer. Functionally, JPX promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and facilitated tumor growth in xenograft mouse model. Further assays revealed that JPX participated in the activation of Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin signaling by regulating miR-33a-5p/Twist1, which in turn promoted the EMT process, ultimately influencing the of lung cancer process. The results indicate that the JPX/miR-33a-5p/Twist1 axis regulates lung carcinoma by activating Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin signaling, suggesting a therapeutic potential for lung cancer treatment.</p>

        <title>Clinical subjects and specimens</title>
        <p id="Par23">Total of 116 lung cancer tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues were collected from the Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Ningbo University (Ningbo, China) and Ningbo Medical Center Lihuili Eastern Hospital (Ningbo, China). All of the patients were diagnosed with primary lung cancer and did not receive preoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. At the same time, general clinical information and detailed pathology records were collected. All patients received written informed consent and the study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Medical School of Ningbo University (Approval No.: NBUSM20171006). All experimental protocols were implemented in accordance with relevant regulations.</p>

        <p id="Par24">Total RNA was isolated from lung cancer tissue and cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. DeNovix DS-11 Spectrophotometer (DeNovix, USA) detects the purity and concentration of RNA. We synthesized cDNA by reverse transcription reaction using a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remove kit (Toyobo, Japan) or a commercial miRNA reverse transcription PCR kit (GenePharma, China). RT-qPCR was conducted using a SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara, Japan) on a Mx3005P real-time PCR System (Stratagene, USA) according to manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Results were normalized using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or U6 as an internal control. To account for the assessment of technical variability, the assays were performed in triplicate for each case.

AgomiRNA is a specially labeled and chemically modified double-stranded small RNA that mimics the endogenous miRNA to regulate the biological function of the target gene. The subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was used to assess the tumor formation ability. First, 5&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>6</sup> lung cancer cells (SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1299) stably expressing miR-NC/miR-33a-5p, and empty plasmid/JPX were suspended in 200&#x2009;&#x3BC;L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then were injected subcutaneously into the right flanks of BALB/c nude mice (single-factor experiment, <italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;7 per group; rescue experiment <italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;3 per group).

        <title>JPX was upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cells</title>
        <p id="Par39">We performed lncRNA microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs using four pairs of human lung cancer tissues and matched nontumor tissues. In total, 1551 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified, of which 817 lncRNAs were highly expressed and of which 734 were lowly expressed (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and b). Our previous work showed that miR-33a-5p could inhibit lung cancer invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Here, we expected to obtain differentially lncRNAs that bind with miR-33a-5p. The miRNA-lncRNA interaction database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/starbase2/index.php">http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/starbase2/index.php</ext-link>) was used to predict the potential lncRNAs that could interact with miR-33a-5p. The results showed that 61 lncRNAs shared binding sites with miR-33a-5p. The overlapping analysis of 1551 differentially expressed lncRNAs and the predicted 61 lncRNAs indicated that only lncRNA JPX interacted with miR-33a-5p via seven consecutive pairings of complementary base pairs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and c). To confirm JPX expression in lung cancer tissues, we performed RT-qPCR to detect JPX in 116 pairs of lung cancer tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues and found significantly higher JPX expression in lung cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). To further investigate the association between the JPX expression and the clinicopathological characteristics, 116 human lung cancer tissue samples were divided into two subgroups according to the median ratio of relative JPX expression: the high JPX group (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;58) and the low JPX group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;58) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). Correlation regression analysis showed that the high JPX expression in 116 lung cancer patients was closely related to large tumor size (<italic>P</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0009) and the advanced TNM stage (<italic>P</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0003). However, gender (<italic>P</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.7077), age (<italic>P</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.4346), smoking history (<italic>P</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.3443), histology (<italic>P</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.9042), tumor location (<italic>P</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.193) and differentiation (<italic>P</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.8095) were not correlated with JPX expression (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In addition, JPX was expressed more frequently in advanced and metastatic lung cancer patients than that in early and non-metastatic lung cancer patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f and g). Next, we measured JPX expression in human normal lung bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and four lung cancer cell lines (SPC-A-1, LTEP-a-2, A549, NCI-H1299) by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>h, JPX expression in these four cell lines was significantly higher than that in the normal lung bronchial epithelial cells. Among the four cell lines, relative JPX expression was the lowest in SPC-A-1 cells and highest in NCI-H1299 cells. Therefore, SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1299 cell lines were selected as subjects for the subsequent cell phenotype assays. Together, the results suggested that JPX was aberrantly upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cells and was closely correlated with tumor size and TNM stage, suggesting an oncogenic role of JPX in lung cancer.

        <title>JPX promoted lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and facilitated lung tumor growth in vivo</title>
        <p id="Par40">To explore the biological function of JPX in lung cancer cells, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were used to specifically knockdown JPX expression, whereas the full-length recombinant plasmid with JPX was used to increase JPX expression. By transfecting three JPX siRNAs, we found that si-JPX#1 could significantly downregulate JPX expression by up to 57&#x2013;71% (Additional&#xA0;file&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, Figure S1A). JPX could be upregulated 21&#x2013;78 fold when transfected with the JPX recombinant plasmid (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, Figure S1B). CCK-8 and colony formation assays revealed that depletion of JPX inhibited the growth and proliferation of SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1299 cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and c), while JPX overexpression promoted cell growth and proliferation in both cell lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b and d). To further investigate the effect of JPX on lung tumor growth in vivo, the xenograft mouse model was generated by subcutaneous injection of lung cancer cell lines (SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1299) stably expressing JPX.

Similar results were also found with NCI-H1299 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h-j).

In contrast, JPX overexpression significantly increased the migration distance in both two cell lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c and d).

        <title>JPX acted as a sponge for miR-33a-5p</title>
        <p id="Par42">To further confirm the interaction between JPX and miR-33a-5p, we firstly identified the subcellular location of JPX in lung cancer cells. Nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation showed that JPX was mainly located in the cytoplasm of lung cancer cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). The most commonly accepted mechanism of cytoplasmic lncRNAs is that of ceRNAs, which inhibit the regulation of target genes by sponging various miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To validate the above theory, we subcloned the wild-type (JPX-WT) and mutated (JPX-MUT) miR-33a-5p binding sites into dual-luciferase reporters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The luciferase assay showed that transfection of miR-33a-5p mimics significantly reduced the relative luciferase activity of JPX-WT-treated lung cancer cells, but did not affect that of JPX-MUT-treated lung cancer cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). To determine the relationship between JPX and miR-33a-5p, we used RT-qPCR assay to evaluate miR-33a-5p expression in lung cancer patients. Compared with the adjacent normal tissues, miR-33a-5p was notably downregulated in lung cancer tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). Interestingly, Pearson correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between the expression level of JPX and miR-33a-5p in lung cancer tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e). In contrast to JPX, tiR-33a-5p expression in four lung cancer cell lines was much lower than that in normal lung bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). In addition, miR-33a-5p was upregulated when the lung cancer cells were transfected with JPX siRNA s (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>g). However, JPX was downregulated when the lung cancer cells were transfected with miR-33a-5p mimics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>h). Taken together, the data suggested that JPX acted as a sponge for miR-33a-5p in lung cancer cells.

        <title>JPX promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells by regulating miR-33a-5p</title>
        <p id="Par43">To investigate whether JPX regulates the cell phenotype via sponging miR-33a-5p, the rescue experiments were employed to detect the effect of JPX and miR-33a-5p on lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The results showed that the cell growth suppression induced by miR-33a-5p overexpression was relieved by restoring JPX in SPC-A-1 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a) and NCI-H1299 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b) cells. In addition, the decrease in cell colony number due to miR-33a-5p overexpression was restored by JPX treatment in the two lung cancer cell lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c and d). The wound healing assay revealed that miR-33a-5p markedly inhibited cell migration in both SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1299 cells, while the effects were abolished by JPX overexpression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e and f). Similarly, the transwell assay showed that miR-33a-5p significantly suppressed the invasion of SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1299 cells; however, these effects were abrogated by JPX overexpression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>g and h).

        <title>JPX promoted lung tumor growth and metastasis in vivo by regulating miR-33a-5p</title>
        <p id="Par44">In order to verify whether miR-33a-5p could inhibit lung cancer cell growth and metastasis in vivo and whether JPX could reverse miR-33a-5p-induced suppression of the malignant process of lung cancer cells, co-expression of miR-33a-5p and JPX in nude mice was conducted by intravenous injection. Subcutaneous tumor formation experiments revealed that JPX overexpression significantly promoted the formation of subcutaneous tumors of lung cancer cells, while miR-33a-5p overexpression abrogated the JPX-enhanced tumorigenicity in vivo (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a and b). By observing lung tissue surfaces in the nude mice metastasis model, it was found that the miR-33a-5p upregulation group could reduce the metastatic lesion compared to the normal controls, while JPX overexpression restored these effects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c). H&amp;E staining showed that miR-33a-5p markedly decreased the number of metastatic lung nodules, whereas the effects were abolished in the JPX overexpression group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d). In addition, IHC assay showed that both Twist1 and &#x3B2;-catenin were significantly increased by upregulating JPX; these effects could be reversed by increasing miR-33a-5p levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e).

        <p id="Par45">Since studies have shown that miR-33a-5p negatively regulates its target gene, <italic>Twist1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], we aimed to further investigate the relationship between JPX and <italic>Twist1</italic> in lung cancer. <italic>Twist1</italic> expression was verified in 95 pairs of lung cancer tissues and adjacent tissues. It was found that <italic>Twist1</italic> was highly expressed in lung cancer tissues compared to that in adjacent tissues (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). Pearson&#x2019;s correlation analysis showed that the JPX expression was positively correlated with <italic>Twist1</italic> in lung cancer patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). As expected, miR-33a-5p was negatively correlated with <italic>Twist1</italic> in lung cancer patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c). <italic>Twist1</italic> was highly expressed in lung cancer cells, which was consistent with JPX expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d). In the xenograft tumor mice, RT-qPCR showed that JPX expression was remarkably upregulated in tumor tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>e).

        <title>JPX/miR-33a-5p/Twist1 axis participated in lung cancer cell EMT progression via the Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin signaling</title>
        <p id="Par46">Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin signaling, a driver of EMT, was investigated by immunological blotting to discern the molecular mechanism underlying the JPX/miR-33a-5p/Twist1 axis in EMT progression. The results showed that the epithelial biomarker of E-cadherin, and GSK-3&#x3B2;, a key regulator of in Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin signal pathway, were upregulated; whereas the mesenchymal biomarkers of N-cadherin and Vimentin, as well as Twist1 as an inducer of EMT, and &#x3B2;-catenin were downregulated in lung cancer cells with JPX knockdown (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a). In contrast, JPX overexpression resulted in the opposite changes in the EMT biomarkers and key regulators of the Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b). To reveal whether miR-33a-5p participated in the EMT process by regulating Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin signaling, we transfected miR-33a-5p mimics into SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1299 cells and found that the protein expression levels of E-cadherin and GSK-3&#x3B2; were increased, whereas those of N-cadherin, Vimentin, Twist1, and &#x3B2;-catenin were decreased. Importantly, JPX overexpression could restore the miR-33a-5p-induced abnormal expression of EMT- and Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin pathway-associated proteins in lung cancer cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c). The cytosolic protein &#x3B2;-catenin is a molecular switch of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, and it accumulates in the cytoplasm to activate the transcription of a series of Wnt signaling target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that JPX could positively regulate &#x3B2;-catenin protein expression, so we speculated that JPX could promote &#x3B2;-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and then enter the nucleus, thereby activating the Wnt signaling pathway. To verify our hypothesis, we isolated nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins in lung cancer cell lines (SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1299) stably expressing JPX and their controls and found that &#x3B2;-catenin expression was reduced in the cytoplasm and significantly increased in the nucleus (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>d). The results indicated that JPX could promote the transfer of &#x3B2;-catenin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to activate the transcription of target genes. In addition, to further prove that JPX could upregulate &#x3B2;-catenin expression, we transfected siRNAs of CTNNB1, which is a gene encoding &#x3B2;-catenin, in lung cancer cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, Figure S2A and B). It was found that si-CTNNB1 could reduce the expression levels of &#x3B2;-catenin and N-cadherin but increase that of E-cadherin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>e). JPX overexpression could restore the CTNNB1 knock down-induced abnormal expression of &#x3B2;-catenin and EMT-related markers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>f). To further confirm whether Twist1 is directly involved in the Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin pathway, we first screened four synthesized siRNAs and found that two of them (named si-Twist1#2, si-Twist1#4) significantly reduced the expression of Twist1 in two lung cancer cell lines (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, Figure S3A and B). Next, it was found that Twist1 knockdown led to an increase in GSK-3&#x3B2; and a decrease in &#x3B2;-catenin in both SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1299 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>g). Interestingly, JPX overexpression could decrease GSK-3&#x3B2; expression and increase &#x3B2;-catenin expression upon the siRNA-mediated Twist1 knockdown in SPC-A-1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>h) and NCI-H1299 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>i) cells.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par48">Although encouraging progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of lung cancer development, the prognosis of patients with advanced lung cancer remains unfavorable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that abnormally expressed lncRNAs are closely related to lung cancer occurrence and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Specifically, lncRNA HCP5 was found to be upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), resulting in increases of <italic>Snail</italic> and <italic>Slug</italic> to promote EMT progression by adsorbing miR-203 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. As an early specific antisense lncRNA, SBF2-AS1 promoted LUAD tumorigenesis through substantially decreased miR-338-3p and miR-362-3p and substantially increased <italic>E2F1</italic>, and served as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target for LUAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Based on our previous work, we have found that miR-33a-5p negatively regulated the target gene of <italic>Twist1</italic> and participated in the EMT process of lung cancer cells. We combined an lncRNA microarray and bioinformatic prediction to screen out lncRNA JPX, which has potential binding sites with miR-33a-5p and is associated with lung cancer tumorigenesis. In this study, we showed that JPX was significantly upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cells. Importantly, JPX promoted lung cancer malignant processes and tumor growth in vivo. The results indicate that JPX plays an oncogenic role in lung cancer.</p>
      <p id="Par49">JPX is a molecular switch that inactivates the X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Recent study has shown that exosomal JPX from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells promotes XIST expression by inhibiting the function of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Relevant research shows that human JPX and its mouse homolog of lncRNA Jpx have great differences in their nucleotide sequences and RNA secondary structures, but both lncRNAs show strong binding to CTCF, and human JPX can functionally compensate for the loss of Jpx in mouse embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It has also been shown that JPX is lowly expressed in HCC and inhibits HepG2 cell growth or tumorigenesis in a XIST-dependent manner, revealing that JPX has a tumor-suppressing effect in HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In addition, highly expressed JPX shows poor prognosis; promotes the proliferation, invasion, and migration of human ovarian cancer cells, and inhibits cell apoptosis by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Recently, there have been reports on JPX in lung cancer. As an oncogene, JPX is significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues and is associated with poor prognosis; JPX upregulates cyclin D2 expression in the ceRNA mechanism by interacting with miR-145-5p, which stimulates NSCLC development and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These studies show that JPX plays different roles in different types of human cancers. On the one hand, JPX acts as an oncogene to promote the development of ovarian and lung cancer. On the other hand, JPX acts as a tumor suppressor gene to inhibit HCC development. In our study, we found for the first time that JPX was highly expressed in lung cancer patients and was significantly linked to tumor size and TNM stage. Interestingly, JPX expression was higher in patients with advanced lung cancer than in those with early lung cancer. Consistently, JPX expression was also higher in patients with metastatic lung cancer than in those without metastasis. We further revealed a negative correlation between JPX and miR-33a-5p in lung cancer patients. The miR-33a-5p-induced inhibition of cell growth and metastasis could be restored by JPX overexpression. Additionally, Twist1<italic>,</italic>a target of miR-33a-5p, was found to be coordinately upregulated with JPX in lung cancer. These findings indicate that JPX plays an oncogenic role via its interaction with miR-33a-5p and Twist1.</p>
      <p id="Par50">In the past decade, ceRNAs have become a very important class of post-transcriptional regulators that affect tumor occurrence and development by altering the corresponding gene expression through miRNA-mediated mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. As a type of ceRNA, lncRNAs can act as molecular sponges to adsorb miRNAs through the same miRNA response elements (MREs), thereby regulating their target genes and ultimately affecting tumor progression. For instance, lncRNA CA7&#x2013;4 regulated the autophagy and apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells by inducing miR-877-3p and miR-5680 under high-glucose condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Similarly, LINC01234 acted as a ceRNA of miR-642a-5p, resulting in the suppression of the endogenous serine hydroxymethyl transferase 2 (SHMT2), suggesting that the LINC01234-miR642a-5p-SHMT2 axis plays a key role in colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. There are also other lncRNAs that play crucial roles as ceRNAs in cancers development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The present work demonstrated that lncRNA JPX, miRNA-33a-5p, and Twist1 constituted a ceRNA network to regulate lung cancer growth and metastasis. However, the ceRNA hypothesis is still in the verification stage, and much research is needed to identify the abundance of the three components and verify the functional activities of ceRNAs.</p>
      <p id="Par51">It has been reported that EMT and the associated Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin pathway can be important drivers of tumor growth and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Twist1 is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family and is an important transcription factor that induces EMT, migration and invasion in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, Twist1 is highly expressed and acts as an oncogene in many invasive types of cancers, such as lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Additionally, studies have shown that Twist1 affects the cancerous behavior of tumor cells via the Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In the current study, we found that JPX could increase Twist1 expression by adsorbing miR-33a-5p, thereby activating Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin signaling pathway to promote EMT progression in lung cancer cells. However, whether Twist1 participates in the Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin pathway directly or indirectly, and whether JPX affects Twist1 expression or regulates other pathways through RNA-binding proteins to promote lung cancer development remain unclear. The above speculation needs further investigation. Importantly, recent studies have shown that lncRNA is closely related to the stemness of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. For example, lncRNA CCAT1 which is notably upregulated in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) and contributes to the stemness of BCSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]; lncRNA SPRY4-IT1 increases TCF7L2 expression by targeting miR-6882-3p, thereby promoting breast cancer cell proliferation and stemness as well as BCSC renewal and maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]; and lncRNA LOXL1-AS1 facilitates the stemness of gastric carcinoma through regulating the miR-708-5p/USF1 axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Although we have not tested the function of JPX in lung cancer stem cells at present, our results provide a deeper understanding of the role of JPX in lung cancer cells as well as a new direction for future research.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p id="Par52">In summary, our results demonstrate that the lncRNA JPX/miRNA-33a-5p/Twist1 axis may act as a new ceRNA regulatory network, participating in the EMT process by activating the Wnt/&#x3B2;-catenin signaling pathway, thus accelerating the malignant processes of lung cancer. These findings suggest that JPX may serve as a potential therapeutic target and a novel biomarker for the precise treatment of lung cancer.</p>
