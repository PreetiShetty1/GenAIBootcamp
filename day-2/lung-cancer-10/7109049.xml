      <title>Background</title>
      <p id="Par5">Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a heterogeneous group of transcripts &gt;200 nucleotides with no protein coding capacity. In relation to their topography of the closest protein-coding gene, lncRNAs have been broadly classified into: sense, antisense, bidirectional, intronic and intergenic lncRNAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> They are largely transcribed by RNA polymerase II, spliced, 5&#x2032; capped, polyadenylated and regulated at multiple levels similarly to the mRNAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> GENCODE release v29 reports 16,066 lncRNA transcripts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Although the function of the majority of lncRNAs is still largely unknown, evidence reveals their participation in many regulatory pathways,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> including chromatin organisation, transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional and post-translational processing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> These functions are exerted by acting as guides, tethers, decoys, scaffolds, competitive endogenous RNAs and miRNA sponges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> In general, lncRNAs show lower expression levels, significantly shorter transcript half-lives and higher cell and tissue specificity than mRNAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup></p>
      <p id="Par6">Dysregulation of lncRNA expression appears to be extensive in cancer, where they act either as oncogenes or tumour repressors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> In the past few years, several pan-cancer transcriptomic analyses have been carried out after thorough realignment and reannotation of thousands of RNA-seq libraries retrieved from TCGA, providing an overview of lncRNA transcriptional alterations in different human cancers. These studies suggest that (a) lncRNAs are frequently dysregulated in tumours, (b) many of these alterations are highly tumour-specific and (c) they are often associated with other cancer-related (epi)genetic alterations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup></p>
      <p id="Par7">Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer-related deaths, and non-small cell lung cancer accounts for the majority of the reported cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Early screening and improved therapies are critical unmet clinical needs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and the field of lncRNAs has attracted a lot of interest in an effort to identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Analysis of publicly available RNA-seq data indicated 111 intergenic lung cancer-associated lncRNAs that were differentially expressed between tumour and adjacent normal lung tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, following a pan-cancer analysis of RNA-seq data from seven additional TCGA solid tumour types, 58 of these were shown to be specific to lung cancer. To date, there are a number of additional studies analysing publicly available lncRNA expression data in lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and fewer attempting validation in independent sample sets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> However, despite the plethora of published papers, the lncRNA landscape in NSCLC is far from comprehensive, mainly because of the limited independent validation, inconsistency of targets and sample sets. In this study, we undertook a lncRNA transcriptome-wide microarray approach and performed both technical and biological validation of a number of highly differential expressed lncRNA targets. Qualified targets from this process were cross validated in TCGA datasets. Expression was also tested in a series of NSCLC cell lines. Finally, we investigated the DNA methylation status of those dysregulated lncRNAs bearing CpG islands in their promoters.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par36">The discovery of long non-coding RNAs has revolutionised biological research, from basic gene function to clinical exploitation as disease specific biomarkers or therapeutic targets. The lncRNA transcriptome constitutes a whole new level of regulation in cell physiology. The promise of utilisation of lncRNAs in translational research and clinical management will rely on validation of differential gene expression levels associated with clinically relevant disease states and outcomes. Although there is still a lot to learn about lncRNA biology, there are already an increasing number of attempts to address lncRNA detection in body fluids to assist lung cancer diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup></p>
      <p id="Par37">The existing lncRNA profiling data in lung cancer to date is substantial. This includes high-throughput approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and targeted studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> However, despite the plethora of reports, the landscape is less clear than one would hope. The main reason is the marked diversity of approaches and validation methods. In addition, with the exception of studies mining existing data in the public domain, most studies utilise limited discovery sample sets, which leads to high FDR.</p>
      <p id="Par38">In this study, we aimed to strengthen the existing data and contribute to a more comprehensive landscape of lncRNA dysregulation in NSCLC. We used a comparatively large discovery set in microarray analysis (44 pairs) and performed both technical (29 pairs) and independent biological (38 pairs) validation of targets by RT-qPCR, in order to identify lncRNA profiles significantly distinguishing NSCLCs tissue from paired normal lung tissue.</p>
      <p id="Par39">Following microarray data analysis and having set the desired thresholds (adjusted p-value (FDR)&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01 and absolute log2 fold-change&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.5) we selected targets for validation with different <italic>p</italic>-values and fold-change values, in order to obtain a representative estimation of validity for our microarray analysis. An important selection factor was gene annotation and verification of probe sequences against locus sequence. For validation, we only selected among targets for which we had cross-referenced the hybridisation probe in the microarray with the annotated gene name in the databases (NCBI Genbank and ENSEMBL). Twelve out of the 14 targets selected for qPCR validation (six up- and six down-regulated in tumours) were successfully validated to demonstrate a strong and consistent difference of expression between NSCLC tissue and normal lung, suggesting a role in lung cancer pathogenesis. Interestingly, the two targets that failed in validation did not represent the highest <italic>p</italic>-values in the microarray analysis, indicating that even 10<sup>&#x2013;2</sup> adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values can be trusted. Surprisingly, a target with a very low p-value in microarray analysis (10<sup>&#x2013;19</sup>) failed to validate, probably indicating potential problems with probe specificity and/or target annotation.</p>
      <p id="Par40">To the best of our knowledge, from the 12 validated lncRNAs, this is the first study where <italic>LANCL1-AS1</italic>, <italic>LINC01214</italic>, <italic>LINC01929</italic>, <italic>NUTM2A-AS1</italic>, <italic>PCAT19</italic> and <italic>SVIL-AS1</italic> are shown to be aberrantly expressed in cancer, while <italic>ADAMTS9-AS2</italic>, <italic>FENDRR</italic>, <italic>FEZF1-AS1</italic>, <italic>LINC00673</italic>, <italic>LINC00968</italic> and <italic>PCAT6</italic> have been previously reported to be dysregulated in lung and other types of cancer. Interestingly, our analysis of the available TCGA datasets demonstrated that all the 12 targets show significant differential expression in NSCLC, increasing further the confidence in this result. Apart from the validation of the RNF139-AS1, the main difference between our dataset and TCGA is centred around clinicopathological associations. A substantial number of associations of these lncRNA targets were found in TCGA, while we only found a few associations of borderline significance. This is not surprising, as TCGA datasets contained 850 tumours as opposed to 67 for our set used for clinicopathological comparisons. The clinicopathological associations revealed within the TCGA dataset point to future research in establishing the potential prognostic value of these targets. In addition, no major associations were found between lncRNA expression and overall survival, with the exception of a few statistical trends (0.02&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) for FEZF1-AS1 and LINC01929 in TCGA dataset and LINC01214 and FENDRR in our dataset. The differences in this finding probably reflects the size difference of the two datasets. Nevertheless, one has to consider that overall survival in lung cancer is a challenging parameter as the cause of death is frequently related to comorbidities and/or therapy related toxicity.</p>
      <p id="Par41"><italic>ADAMTS9-AS2</italic> was previously found dysregulated in several cancer types including NSCLC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> Overexpression of <italic>ADAMTS9-AS2</italic> reduces proliferation, cell migration, invasion, and induces apoptosis in vitro while restrains tumour growth in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> Recent evidence suggests that <italic>ADAMTS9-AS2</italic> might exert its function by &#x2018;sponging&#x2019; common microRNAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> For instance, in NSCLC, <italic>ADAMTS9-AS2</italic> represses cancer progression by regulating the miR-223-3p/TGFBR3 axis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> while in ovarian cancer it regulates the miR-182-5p/FOXF2 pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup></p>
      <p id="Par42">A few studies have analysed the role of <italic>FENDDR</italic> in various cancer types suggesting that <italic>FENDRR</italic> plays an inhibitory role in tumour progression by regulating cell migration, invasion and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>
<italic>FENDRR</italic> was found to be downregulated in gastric cancer tissues, which increased cell migration and invasion in vitro through up-regulation of FN1 and MMP2 and MMP9.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>
<italic>FENDRR</italic> expression was also shown to be suppressed in gastric cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) by hypermethylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> In NSCLC, we have observed that <italic>FENDRR</italic> expression is reduced in lung tumours compared with paired normal tissue and lung cancer cell lines showed a similar trend. This result is in agreement with a previous study reporting a significant downregulation of <italic>FENDRR</italic> in NSCLC as well as a potential involvement of <italic>FENDRR</italic> in regulating epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), stemness and metastasis of lung cancer cells via EZH2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup></p>
      <p id="Par43">Our finding on <italic>FEZF1-AS1</italic> upregulation in NSCLC is in agreement with previous reports on many tumour types including NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and breast.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>
<italic>FEZF1-AS1</italic> exerts regulatory functions at a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In fact, it has been reported to modulate the expression of Nanog by sponging miR-30a to promote cancer stemness in breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> However, <italic>FEZF1-AS1</italic> can also act at a transcriptional level by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes to target genes. For instance, <italic>FEZF1-AS1</italic> can bind to LSD1 and EZH2 and epigenetically repress E-cadherin in NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> or p57 in lung adenocarcinomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup></p>
      <p id="Par44">In our dataset, <italic>LINC00673</italic> was overexpressed in lung tumours, which is in agreement with previous reports on NSCLC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> Upregulation of <italic>LINC00673</italic> has also been reported in gastric cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> having a role in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. <italic>LINC00673</italic> transcripts have been localised both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> suggesting that it can function at a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In NSCLC, Lu <italic>et al</italic> proposed that <italic>LINC00673</italic> promotes TGF-&#x3B2; induced EMT by sponging miR-150-5p and thereby modulating ZEB1 expression indirectly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> In addition, Roth <italic>et al</italic> have reported that <italic>LINC00673</italic> negatively regulates p53 translation by directly interacting with its 3&#x2032;UTR leading to senescence bypass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>
<italic>LINC00673</italic> can also regulate the expression of target genes epigenetically. Notably, in lung cancer, <italic>LINC00673</italic> represses HOXA5 expression through recruiting the epigenetic repressor EZH2 to its promoter region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> Shi <italic>et al</italic> observed that <italic>LINC00673</italic> epigenetically inhibited NCALD expression through direct binding to LSD1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> In a similar way, in gastric cancer <italic>LINC00673</italic> suppressed KLF4 expression by interacting with EZH2 and DNMT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and direct binding to LSD1 and EZH2 repressed KLF2 and LATS2 expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup></p>
      <p id="Par45">Regarding <italic>PCAT6</italic>, our findings are in line with previous studies reporting its upregulation in various cancer types including NSCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> and colon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> Functional studies have shown that <italic>PCAT6</italic> exerts its oncogenic activity, at least partly, by leading chromatin-modifying complexes to specific promoter regions. For instance, in NSCLC, <italic>PCAT6</italic> interacts with EZH2 epigenetically, suppressing LATS2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> while in colon cancer, the association of <italic>PCAT6</italic> with EZH2 modulates ARC expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup></p>
      <p id="Par46">We observed that <italic>LINC00968</italic> was significantly downregulated in lung tumours compared with paired normal lung and completely absent in lung cancer cell lines, which is in contrast to a previous study reporting upregulation of <italic>LINC00968</italic> in NSCLC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> However, that study evaluated <italic>LINC00968</italic> expression using datasets from the Oncomine database and four NSCLC cell lines, whereas we performed wet validation in 82 NSCLC tissue samples and 13 NSCLC cell lines. We speculate that inconsistency of results may lie with incorrect annotation in the previous bioinformatic analysis.</p>
      <p id="Par47">To explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for the modulated expression observed, we hypothesised that DNA methylation might be one of the mechanisms responsible. Therefore, we undertook DNA methylation analysis in seven of our target genes that were found to bear a CpG island in their promoter. Of those, hypermethylation was detected only in three, namely <italic>FENDRR</italic>, <italic>SVIL-AS1</italic> and <italic>FEZF1-AS1</italic>. There was a general lack of correlation between expression and DNA methylation in the genes tested. This may be due to the low number of common samples in the two analyses, but it most likely indicates the presence of strong alternative regulation factors besides DNA methylation. <italic>FENDRR</italic> hypermethylation has previously been shown in gastric CAFs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>
<italic>FENDRR</italic> promoter methylation demonstrated a significant increase in adenocarcinoma, however this was not the case for <italic>FENDRR</italic> expression.</p>
      <p id="Par48">This study contributes significantly to the wider knowledge of lncRNA involvement in NSCLC pathogenesis. Its strength lies with the technical and independent biological validation in patient tissues as well as its agreement with the available relevant TCGA datasets. Out of the 12 validated targets, half are shown to be differentially expressed in cancer for the first time, while our results for the other six lncRNAs confirm previous findings. Certainly, there are still a large number of dysregulated candidate lncRNAs in our microarray analysis list that require independent validation. Our data have been made publicly available, therefore open to other research groups to attempt independent validation. To date, the involvement of lncRNAs in NSCLC development is undisputable; however, further studies are needed to establish additional lncRNA targets and to identify their functional role in the pathogenesis of NSCLC.</p>
